            <h2>Best All Rounder Player.</h2>
            <p>Shakib Al Hasan made his Test debut in 2007 against India. His breakthrough came in the Test against New Zealand in Chittagong in 2008 where he picked up 7 wickets for 36 runs, the best figures by a Bangladeshi bowler at that time. He quickly established himself as one of the team's leading performers. He has scored over 4,000 runs and taken more than 200 wickets in the format. He has also captained the team on their first-ever Test match win over England in 2016.[15] In ODIs, Shakib has been more successful. He has scored over 6,000 runs and taken more than 270 wickets in the format, becoming the fastest and only player in history to achieve the double of 5,000 runs and 250 wickets in ODIs.[16] In the 2012 Asia Cup, Shakib scored 237 runs, including three fifties, and took six wickets. Bangladesh progressed to the tournament's final for the first time but eventually lost to Pakistan by 2 runs. He is considered one of the most impactful players of the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup,[17] where he broke the record of maximum runs scored in the group stages of the World Cup which was previously held by Sachin Tendulkar and finished as the third-highest run-scorer scoring 606 runs in total at the tournament</p>
